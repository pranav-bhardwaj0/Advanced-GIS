## About me
I'm a first-year MSPPM - Data Analytics student from Singapore, with an Earth Science and Environmental Studies background from my undergraduate degree. As such, GIS was a big part of my coursework and research. I used open-source data to analyze the multivariate factors that contribute to landslide risk and hazard in distinct geographies around the world, with the hope of understanding how governments can better utilize their resources for disaster management. As someone who has been raised all over the world, I love using maps and statistics to understand earth systems globally, and how climate change will affect our society in the near future.

Outside of my academic interests, mapping is still a large of my hobbies/interests. My favourite show is The Amazing Race, and I love seeing the different countries that the teams visit, and the transportation routes that they take on the race. I'm also a huge basketball fan, so March Madness is another way that I engage with maps. I love seeing how the "bracket" turns out through the geographical relationship between school location and arena location nationally. 

## What I hope to learn
My GIS skills are pretty focused on physical geography using a variety of data sources. One of the things I want to learn better through the course is how to integrate other data skills (Python, SQL, or R) to better tell stories about data through maps. Integrating a variety of different/disparate sources, and resources is one of the things that I want to continue to build upon. This is always a tricky task, and the content of this class will definitely put this to practice. 

## What I have learned
After reflecting on the class, learning about geospatial data science techniques have been very insightful. For someone who has a baseline knowledge of some machine learning algorithms, applying them to geospatial analysis and creating maps has been very useful to me. This class was also a great refresher on data visualizations which are always important in research or the working world. This is best reflected in my project, where I can do a variety of spatial analysis (at different scales, globally, nationally etc.), and I can apply some very complex algorithms to geospatial data. 

One of the best parts of this class was to outline the new ESRI tools, their benefits and their limitations. I think understanding these things is an excellent practice in project management - something that I am likely to going to pursue as a full-time career. For example: 
- The Spatial Analyst Toolbox hsa a lot of classification and regression algorithms, which are very easy to use. However, 
- GeoEnrichment
- ArcGIS Insights was a great tool in data visualizations, and data consolodation. Although limited in some of their data visualization capabilities, it is a good introduction to dashboarding. 

Another thing that I wanted to get out of this class was to setup my Github page better. I have a lot of analytical projects from the past semesters that would be great to display, as well as show employers when I start applying to full time jobs. Below is a sample of how I would setup my page (similar to a resume or Linkedin page), but with more technical focus.
