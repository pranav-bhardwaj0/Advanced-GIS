## About me
I'm a first-year MSPPM - Data Analytics student, with an Earth Science and Environmental Studies background from my undergraduate degree. As such, GIS was a big part of my coursework, and even research. I used open-source data to analyze the the multivariate factors that contirbute to landslide risk and hazard in distinct geographies around the world, with the hope of understanding how governments can better utilize their resources for disaster management. As someone who has been raised all over the world, I love using maps and statistics 

## What I hope to learn
My GIS skills are pretty focused on physical geography using a variety of data sources. One of the things I want to learn better through the course is how to integrate other data-skills (Python, SQL or R) to better tell stories about data through maps. Integrating a variety of different sources, and resources is one of the things that I want to continue building upon.
