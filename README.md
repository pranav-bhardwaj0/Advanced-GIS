## About me
I'm a first-year MSPPM - Data Analytics student from Singapore, with an Earth Science and Environmental Studies background from my undergraduate degree. As such, GIS was a big part of my coursework and research. I used open-source data to analyze the multivariate factors that contribute to landslide risk and hazard in distinct geographies around the world, with the hope of understanding how governments can better utilize their resources for disaster management. As someone who has been raised all over the world, I love using maps and statistics to understand earth systems globally, and how climate change will affect our society in the near future.

Outside of my academic interests, mapping is still a large of my hobbies/interests. My favourite show is The Amazing Race, and I love seeing the different countries that the teams visit, and the transportation routes that they take on the race. I'm also a huge basketball fan, so March Madness is another way that I engage with maps. I love seeing how the "bracket" turns out through the geographical relationship between school location and arena location nationally. 

## What I hope to learn
My GIS skills are pretty focused on physical geography using a variety of data sources. One of the things I want to learn better through the course is how to integrate other data skills (Python, SQL, or R) to better tell stories about data through maps. Integrating a variety of different/disparate sources, and resources is one of the things that I want to continue to build upon. This is always a tricky task, and the content of this class will definitely put this to practice.
